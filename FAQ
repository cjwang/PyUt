1. Reverse engineering Python
=============================
Reverse engineering Python launches my program. Why ?
Q: When I do Python Reverse engineering on my program, my program
    is launched. Why ?
A: Python Reverse does an 'import' on python files.
    An Import launches all the code that is found in the imported module.
    To fix it, you must add this kind of code in your program :
    if __name__=="__main__":
        do_some_stuff
    This is general stuff, it is a good idea to put this in all your code.
