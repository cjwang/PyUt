PYUT
𝓟 𝓨 𝓤 𝓣 stands for Python UML Tool. Actually, Pyut is only a class diagram editor


This is a Python 3 version of a source forge project.  This is the [original web site](http://pyut.sourceforge.net/whatis.html)

I asked the original developers of forking this project.  This is what one replied
